- 🌏 **From Struggle to Code: My Journey**  

I was born in Myanmar, but at 9 years old, I had to flee due to persecution and genocide against our community (Rohingya). Life in a refugee camp meant **no formal education, no freedom, and limited resources**. Yet, I refused to let circumstances define my future.  

One way I found hope and empowerment was through coding. Recently, I built a **simple calculator in Python** 🐍—a small project, but a big step in my learning journey.  

Over the years, I’ve also explored:  
- **JavaScript, HTML, CSS** – building dynamic web pages 🌐  
- **C** – understanding the foundations of programming 💡  

Each project represents **resilience, learning, and creativity**. Coding has shown me that challenges aren’t barriers—they’re opportunities to grow and create impact.
